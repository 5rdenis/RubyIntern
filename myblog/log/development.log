This means that in Ruby programs we work with objects. From a language programmer's point of view a Ruby program is a stream of tokens.

These objects are created and modified during the lifetime of a Ruby script.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of objects: built-in objects and custom objects. Built-in objects are predefined objects that all programmers can use. They are available with the core of the Ruby language or from various libraries.
